Have you always felt left out of the newest crypto frenzy? Did you miss all the altcoins run and the NFT frenzy in 2021? We are building low-code solutions to index the on chain blockchain data and search with a very simple UI. With the  introduction of python client in Dune API you can get any on chain data and utilize this data to make insightful business decision. We then use multimodal neural search engine so you can index your data with few lines of code and search either by text or image. As a first prototype, we have developed and deployed a low code neral search engine to search the NFT ape, We have already suggested some prompt for you to try or please come up with your own prompt. In the newest version you will also be able to search with other image so you can search similar NFT as your favorite one. We have also allowed you to filter NFT with different tags. Combining the power of Dune Analytics and its api with the usability of Jina neural search engine we would like to enable anybody to get the on chain data and never miss another life changing crypto trends.
